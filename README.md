# ðŸ›’ Evaluating Financial Impact of Cart Add-Ons and Experimentation Plan

## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the impact of increasing the visibility of non-medication items (such as vitamins or bandages) during the checkout process on an online pharmacy platform. The goal is to determine whether the visibility enhancement leads to more customers adding these items to their carts, thereby increasing overall revenue.

## Objectives
Estimate Financial Impact: Project the revenue increase if 20% of customers add non-medication items.

A/B Test Design: Randomly assign customers into control (default visibility) and test (enhanced visibility) groups.

Analyze Results: Measure key metrics like the number of customers adding non-medication items and total revenue for each group.

Statistical Significance: Use a chi-squared test to determine if the differences in behavior between the two groups are statistically significant.
